            <h2>About Whalesharks</h2>
            <p>The whale shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. 
                The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8 m (61.7 ft).[8] The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, 
                most notably being by far the most massive living non-cetacean animal. 
                It is the sole member of the genus <strong>Rhincodon</strong> and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae, 
                which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. 
                Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Whale sharks possess a broad, flattened head with a large mouth and two small eyes located at the front corners.[14][15] Unlike many other sharks, whale shark mouths are located at the front of the head rather than on the underside of the head.[16] A 12.1 m (39.7 ft) whale shark was reported to have a mouth 1.55 m (5.1 ft) across.[17] Whale shark mouths can contain over 300 rows of tiny teeth and 20 filter pads which it uses to filter feed.[18] The spiracles are located just behind the eyes. Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills. Their skin is dark grey with a white belly marked with an arrangement of pale grey or white spots and stripes that is unique to each individual. The skin can be up to 15 cm (5.9 in) thick and is very hard and rough to the touch. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides, which start above and behind the head and end at the caudal peduncle.[15] The shark has two dorsal fins set relatively far back on the body, a pair of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins and a single medial anal fin. The caudal fin has a larger upper lobe than the lower lobe (heterocercal).

                Whale sharks have been found to possess dermal denticles on the surface of their eyeballs that are structured differently from their body denticles. The dermal denticles, as well as the whale shark's ability to retract its eyes deep into their sockets, serve to protect the eyes from damage.[19][20]
                
                Evidence suggests that whale sharks can recover from major injuries and may be able to regenerate small sections of their fins. Their spot markings have also been shown to reform over a previously wounded area.[21]
                
                The complete and annotated genome of the whale shark was published in 2017.[22]
                
                Rhodopsin, the light-sensing pigment in the rod cells of the retina, is normally sensitive to green and used to see in dim light, but in the whale shark (and the bottom-dwelling cloudy catshark) two amino acid substitutions make the pigment more sensitive to blue light instead, the light that dominates the deep ocean. One of these mutations also makes rhodopsin vulnerable to higher temperatures. In humans, a similar mutation leads to congenital stationary night blindness, as the human body temperature makes the pigment decay.[23][24] This pigment becomes unstable in shallow water, where the temperature is higher and the full spectrum of light is present. To protect from this instability, the whale shark deactivates the pigment when in shallow water (as otherwise the pigment would hinder full color vision). In the colder environment at 2,000 meters below the surface where the shark dives, it is activated again.[25] The mutations thus allow the shark to see well at both ends of its great vertical range.[26][27] The eyes have also lost all cone opsins except LWS.[28]</p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Whale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans. They are rarely found in water below 21 °C (70 °F).[2] 
                Whale sharks' lifespans are estimated to be between 80 and 130 years, based on studies of their vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming sharks.[9][10][11] 
                Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. 
                They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes, and do not pose any threat to humans.

                The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6 m (15 ft) specimen in Table Bay, 
                South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year.[12] 
                The name "whale shark" refers to the animal's appearance and large size; it is a fish, not a mammal, and (like all sharks) is not closely related to whales.</p>

            <h2>Size</h2>
            <p>The whale shark is the largest non-cetacean animal in the world. However, the maximum size and growth patterns of the species are not well understood.[8][29]

                Limited evidence, mostly from males, suggests that sexual maturity occurs around 8 to 9 meters (26 to 30 ft) in length, with the possibility of females sexually maturing at a similar size or larger.[14][30][31][32]
                
                Various studies have aimed to estimate the growth and longevity of whale sharks, either by analysing evidence from vertebral growth rings or measurements taken from re-sighted sharks over several years. This information is used to model growth curves, which can predict asymptotic length. The growth curves produced from these studies have estimated asymptotic lengths ranging from 15 to 21.9 meters (49 to 72 ft).[11][33][34][29][9]
                
                A 2020 study looked at the growth of whale shark individuals over a 10-year period around the Ningaloo Reef and concluded the species exhibits sexual dimorphism with regard to size, with females growing larger than males. The study found that males on average reach 8 to 9 meters (26 to 30 ft) in length. The same study had less female data but estimated an average length of around 14.5 m (48 ft). However, this value dropped to 12.1 m (40 ft) if data from aquarium whale sharks was included. The authors noted that these estimates represent average asymptotic size and are not the maximum sizes possible. Additionally, they acknowledged the potential for regional size variation.[29]
                
                Most previous growth studies have had data predominately from males and none have data from sharks over ~10 m (33 ft). Not all previous studies created separate growth curves for males and females, instead combining data from both sexes. Those studies that made sex-specific growth curves have estimated large asymptotic length estimates for males, with lengths of 18 m (59 ft) or more. However, mostly immature males were available in these studies, with few adults to constrain the upper portion of the growth curves.[29]
                
                The largest total length for the species is uncertain due to a lack of detailed documentation of the largest reported individuals. Whale sharks as large as 18 to 20 meters (59 to 66 ft) in length have been reported in scientific literature. However, most whale sharks observed are smaller.[8]
                
                Large whale sharks are difficult to measure accurately, both on the land and in the water. When on land, the total length measurement can be affected by how the tail is positioned, either angled as it would be in life or stretched as far as possible. Historically, techniques such as comparisons to objects of known size and knotted ropes have been used for in-water measurements, but these techniques may be inaccurate.[31] Various forms of photogrammetry have been used to improve the accuracy of in-water measurements, including underwater and aerial techniques</p>
